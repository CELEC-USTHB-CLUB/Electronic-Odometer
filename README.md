# Electronic-Odometer
An odometer is an important device in a vehicle that measures the distance travelled by the vehicle. In this project, we have built an electronic odometer based on ATmega328P-AU microcontroller. This odometer system uses a sensor to detect the rotations of the vehicle's wheel and calculates the distance travelled. We would like to thank JLCPCB for providing us with their good manufacturing and SMT services and also for sponsoring our club https://jlcpcb.com/RAT.

# Details
When the wheel rotates, the sensor detects the change  and generates a pulse. The ATmega328P-AU microcontroller counts the number of pulses and calculates the distance travelled based on the circumference of the wheel. The distance travelled is then displayed on the 16x2 LCD display.
